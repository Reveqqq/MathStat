# Math Stat Labs

## Lab 1
Generated sequences for different distributions. Calculated mean, std, medians and var for all sequences.

## Lab 2
Generated sequences for different distributions. Plot cdf and ecdf with confidence interval

## Lab 3
Estimated the distribution parameters using the built-in bootstrap method. The plot shows the pdf, true mean, std and confidence interval for the mean. Performed estimation by the maximum likelihood.

## Lab 4
Built a correlation matrix. Created the heatmap using seabourn.
Took the signs that have the maximum and minimum modulo correlation coefficient and displayed a diagram of their scattering with a regression line.
Built a linear regression model using sm.OLS using the last column as a dependent feature and made 3 predictions for some lines.
